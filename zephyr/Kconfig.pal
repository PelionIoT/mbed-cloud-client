config IZUMA_PAL_SUPPORT_NAT64
    bool "Automatic NAT64 address support on IPv6 networks"
    default y
    help
      Help IPv6 devices behind NAT64 use public DNS servers by converting
      IPv4 addresses to IPv6 using default NAT64 prefix. Only comes into
      effect when an IPv6-only device receives an IPv4 address from the DNS
      server.

config IZUMA_PAL_SUPPORT_SSL_CONNECTION_ID
    bool "Use Connection Identifiers for DTLS 1.2"
    help
      Connection ID is an extention to DTLS 1.2 that allows a DTLS session
      to persist even if the device's IP address and port changes, which
      otherwise would require a new DTLS handshake. This enables devices
      to power down their network interface for long periods of time,
      saving power and network bandwidth.

      Requires mbed TLS 2.18.0 or newer and transport mode to be UDP or
      UDP Queue.

config IZUMA_PAL_USE_APPLICATION_REBOOT
    bool "Use reboot function provided by application"
    help
      Override default reboot function with one provided by application.
      Useful for shutting down the device gracefully, powering down external
      components and saving state.

      Signature for C function:
        void pal_plat_osApplicationReboot(void)

config IZUMA_PAL_USE_APPLICATION_NETWORK_CALLBACK
    bool "Use network status callback provided by application"
    help
      Provide setter for registering network status callback function in
      application. Application uses callback function to notify Izuma client
      about changes in network connectivity, enabling the client to refrain
      from sending data during network loss.

      Signature for C function:
      #include "pal.h"
      palStatus_t pal_plat_setConnectionStatusCallback(uint32_t interfaceIndex,
                                                       connectionStatusCallback callback,

      Select DNS API used by network abstraction implementation.

    config IZUMA_PAL_USE_DNS_API_POSIX
        bool "POSIX"
        help
          Use POSIX's getaddrinfo. This call is synchronous and maps to
          Izuma's DNS version 0.

    config IZUMA_PAL_USE_DNS_API_RESOLVE
        bool "DNS Resolve"
        depends on DNS_RESOLVER
        help
          NOTE! Do not use this feature right now. Issues with reconnecting.
          Use DNS Resolve's dns_get_addr_info. This call is asynchronous and maps
          to Izuma's DNS version 3.

      formatting floating points in LwM2M resources.
